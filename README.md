# mega-player-server
##WIP

Backend that will allow for the creation of player instances in a database. 

##Setup
After cloning the repo, ensure that NPM is installed, as it is used to manage dependencies.
If you do not have one already, set up an [Mlab](https://mlab.com/) account and create and fill out the `.env` file appropriately.


>As this project is a work in progress, not many features have been completed or even planned at this point. Any future development may break any 3rd party addons.
